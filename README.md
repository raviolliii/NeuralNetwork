# NeuralNetwork

A super simple neural network that can recognize hand written digits 
(from the MNIST handwritten digit database).

Current Accuracy: ** 97.82% ** (given specific set of parameters)

## Usage

Download the whole repo, running `python3 main.py` will create the network, train it,
and test it. It'll take some time, but it'll work. 

I won't explain specific parameter usage in detail just yet, since I'm still working on 
cleaning up parts of the code.
